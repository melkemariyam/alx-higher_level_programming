Python - if/else, loops, functions

    Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the Python programming language: if/elif/else loops, range, ord(), chr(), modulo, copy of string, bytecode

Description of what each file shows:

    Files that start with: (all python scripts execpt #13)

    print whether the random number is positive or negative
    print the last digit of the number stored in prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new linvariable
    prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
    prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line
    prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal
    prints numbers from 0 to 99
    prints all possible different combinations of two digits
    function that checks for lowercase character
    function that prints the last digit of a number
    function that print a string in uppercase followed by a new line
    function that computes a to the power of b and return the value
    function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space - FizzBuzz
    function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list
    prints the alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line
    function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”)
    Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

              3 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              6 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
              9 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       16

             31 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             34 BINARY_ADD
             35 RETURN_VALUE

             39 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             42 BINARY_MULTIPLY
             43 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             46 BINARY_SUBTRACT
             47 RETURN_VALUE
